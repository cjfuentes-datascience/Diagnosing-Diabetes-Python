# Diagnosing-Diabetes-Python

In this project, I’ll pretend to be a data scientist exploring data that looks at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients.

I'll be using my exploratory data analysis skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.

Note: This dataset is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains the following columns:

1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
6. BMI: Body mass index
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age: Age (years)
9. Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

Let’s get started!
